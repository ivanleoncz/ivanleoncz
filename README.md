## Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I work as Independent Contractor for companies abroad and sometimes here in Mexico as well, developing from Backend Services (Monolithic or Microservices) to Data Engineering projects (I love SQL).

This is the stack which I generally I have been working for the last few years:
- Python
- Django
- Flask
- SQL
- AWS
- Docker
- GNU/Linux
- Shellscripting

I also worked with:
- C
- Java for Android
- Javascript / Bootstrap
- ZABBIX
- HA Proxy
- Nginx

You might see me doing something with other languages like C++, Go, Java, JS. If you have a project that has components written in any of these languages, I'd be happy to learn more about it.
If you have projects related with Climate Change, Sustaintability and Social Impact, I'd be happy to contribute, even as voluntary.

If you need any help: ivanlmj at gmail dot com
