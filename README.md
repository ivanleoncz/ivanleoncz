### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

> Personal are being moved to: https://gitlab.com/ivanleoncz

I work as Independent Contractor for companies abroad and sometimes here in Mexico as well, developing from Backend Services (Monolithic or Microservices) to contributing with Data Engineering projects.

This is the stack that I've been working for the last few years: Python, Django, Flask, SQL, AWS, Docker, GNU/Linux, Shellscripting.
I also worked with other stuff, from Software Development to Infrastructure: C++, Node, Java for Android, GCP, ZABBIX, HA Proxy, Nginx.

If you have projects related with Climate Change, Sustaintability and Social Impact, I'd be happy to contribute, even as voluntary.
