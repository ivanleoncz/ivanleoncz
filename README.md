Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I work as Independent Contractor for companies abroad and sometimes here in Mexico as well, developing Backend Services (Monolithic or Microservices), also contributing with Data Engineering projects.

This is the stack that I've been working for the last few years: Python, Django, Flask, SQL, AWS, Apache Airflow, Docker, GNU/Linux, Shellscripting.
I also worked with other stuff, from Development to Infrastructure: C++, Node, Java, GCP, ZABBIX, HA Proxy, Nginx.

If you have projects related with Climate Change, Sustaintability and Social Impact, I'd be happy to contribute, even as voluntary.
