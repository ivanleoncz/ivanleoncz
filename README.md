### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

#### Projects are being moved to: https://gitlab.com/ivanleoncz

I work as Independent Contractor for companies abroad and sometimes here in Mexico as well, developing from Backend Services (Monolithic or Microservices) to Data Engineering projects (I love SQL).

This is the stack that I've been working for the last few years: Python, Django, Flask, SQL, AWS, Docker, GNU/Linux, Shellscripting.
I also worked with other stuff, from Software Development to Infrastructure Services: C, Node, Java for Android, Bootstrap, ZABBIX, HA Proxy, Nginx.
You might see me doing something with other languages like C++, Go, Java, JS.

If you have:
- a project that has components written in any of these languages, I'd be happy to learn more about it.
- projects related with Climate Change, Sustaintability and Social Impact, I'd be happy to contribute, even as voluntary.

If you need any help: ivanlmj at gmail dot com
